# CookNBook 



A website where the User can choose between cusine types (e.g: asian, mexican etc) and depending on the bottom the user clicks the user will be shown restaurante/bars/ places around him on google maps

The user then can choose a restaurant and gets random/ general info on the food

As an alternative the user will be shown a recipe if the user does not want to to restaurant, or if places is closed etc.
